Description: This package provides wrapper functions to process X-ray Energy
    Dispersive Spectra (XEDS) from NIST DTSA-II and data cubes from NIST Lispix.
    This was adapted from pre-release code from Jeff Davis at NIST (for microR),
    adapted to get it into a workable R package documented by roxygen2.
    TO DO: figure out ROI in DataCube... Check some warnings from roxygen2...
Depends:
    R (>= 3.1.0), tcltk, rtiff
